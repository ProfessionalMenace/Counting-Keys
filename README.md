This program is for counting how many keys you pressed during the day (you have to put in background, and after some hours you can check), it's not going to be a huge project, i wanted to do that for fun.

( wip... 0.1 )
PROBLEMS: lagging, debounce not working properly, there aren't special characters

(So, i was despairing because i was trying to know how to import libraries in C++, and i wanna just chill rn, and
python is good for chilling üëç)
